# Proto UI Module Capability Index

> Internal governance reference. This document is a practical index for `Adapter Author` work. It summarizes what each module package provides, whether it is required or optional, what host caps it expects, what it depends on, and what happens if an adapter does not support it.

---

## 1. Purpose

Proto UI modules are capability units consumed mainly by adapters.

This document exists to help adapter authors answer:

- what capability a module provides
- whether the module is required, recommended, or optional
- which host caps the adapter must provide
- which other modules it depends on
- what functionality is lost if the module is not supported

This is primarily an adapter-design reference.

It is not a full architecture document.

---

## 2. How To Read This Document

Use the following status meanings:

- `Required`: an adapter should normally support this for Proto UI to remain meaningfully usable
- `Strongly recommended`: not universally mandatory, but usually important for host fidelity or web-facing ergonomics
- `Optional`: may be omitted if the host cannot express the capability faithfully
- `Structural`: a base or infrastructure module rather than a direct user-facing capability

Module support should be judged by host truthfulness, not by raw quantity.

It is better for an adapter to refuse a module honestly than to pretend to support it badly.

---

## 3. Typical Integration Pattern

In normal adapter work, a module is not integrated by touching its internals directly.

The usual path is:

1. build the adapter on top of `@proto.ui/adapter-base`
2. decide which modules the adapter intends to support
3. attach selected modules through generic wiring such as `createCapsWiring().use(moduleName, entries)` or equivalent `wiring.attach(moduleName, entries)` logic
4. import the caps or host helpers required by those modules from the module packages themselves
5. provide the host caps required by that module

The practical rule is:

- the adapter chooses the module
- the adapter provides the host caps
- the module consumes those caps through runtime wiring

Additional boundary rules:

- `@proto.ui/adapter-base` provides generic adapter scaffolding, but should not own concrete `useXxx()` helpers for every module
- if a helper is host-specific and only meaningful for one module, it should usually live with that module package
- unrelated module chains may consume the same host-cap if the host meaning is genuinely the same
- within a single dependency chain, downstream modules should reuse upstream module outputs or facades rather than requesting the same raw host-cap again

For example, `@proto.ui/module-expose` owns the internal expose registry, while `@proto.ui/module-expose-state` owns the outward host sink that publishes the final expose record.

So this document should be read as both:

- a capability index
- a host-cap checklist for adapter authors

## 4. Structural Module

| Package | Status | Purpose | Host-cap | Depends on | If omitted | Wiring note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@proto.ui/module-base` | Structural | Shared root and structural contract for all module packages | None direct | None | Other modules cannot be formed in the expected Proto UI module shape | Structural base only; not usually wired as a standalone capability module |

## 5. Capability Index

| Package | Status | Capability | Host-cap | Depends on | If omitted | Wiring note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@proto.ui/module-anatomy` | Required | Provides anatomy capabilities so a prototype can query related parts and subscribe to exposed state or methods in a larger family structure | `ANATOMY_INSTANCE_TOKEN_CAP`, `ANATOMY_PARENT_CAP`, `ANATOMY_GET_PROTO_CAP`, `ANATOMY_ROOT_TARGET_CAP`, optional `ANATOMY_ORDER_OBSERVER_CAP` | None | Prototypes lose cross-part anatomy awareness and family-level coordination | Wire explicitly through generic wiring; web adapters may use `createDomOrderObserver` from this package |

| `@proto.ui/module-expose` | Required | Lets prototypes register behaviors and values for outward exposure | None direct | None | Expose declarations can still exist internally, but there is no adapter-facing publish path for final outward handles | Do not attach a host sink here; pair with `@proto.ui/module-expose-state` when the adapter needs outward expose publishing |
| `@proto.ui/module-expose-state` | Required | Normalizes DX and host collaboration when a prototype exposes state outward | `EXPOSE_STATE_SET_EXPOSES_CAP` | `@proto.ui/module-expose`, `@proto.ui/module-state` | Exposed state loses the unified subscription and host-collaboration model | This module owns the adapter-facing expose sink and should consume expose/state outputs rather than re-requesting the same upstream host meaning |
| `@proto.ui/module-expose-state-web` | Strongly recommended | Mirrors exposed state changes to DOM attributes and CSS variables in web hosts | `HOST_ELEMENT_CAP`, `EXPOSE_STATE_WEB_MAP_CAP`, optional `EXPOSE_STATE_WEB_MODE_CAP` | `@proto.ui/module-expose-state` | Web output loses convenient DOM or CSS reflection of exposed state | Wire explicitly through generic wiring; import any web-only mapping helpers from this package |

| `@proto.ui/module-rule-meta` | Optional | Extends rule `when` expressions with system-level metadata such as theme preference | `RULE_META_GET_CAP` | None | Rule expressions cannot depend on these additional system-level signals | Wire explicitly through generic wiring |
| `@proto.ui/module-state` | Required | Provides the unified Proto UI state model | None direct | None | Prototypes lose the standard state authoring and state-machine-like behavior model | Pure capability layer in the current design; no module-specific host cap |
| `@proto.ui/module-state-accessibility` | Required | Adds accessibility-derived state APIs such as `fromAccessibility` | None direct | `@proto.ui/module-state` | State cannot express the standard accessibility-derived sub-API | Depends on state semantics more than host wiring in the current design |
| `@proto.ui/module-state-interaction` | Required | Adds interaction-derived state APIs such as hover- and focus-related state projections | None direct | `@proto.ui/module-state`, `@proto.ui/module-event` | State cannot express official interaction-derived state signals | Depends on event and state flow rather than dedicated host caps |

## 6. Adapter Design Guidance

When designing an adapter, use the module list in this order:

1. confirm the required modules first
2. decide which strongly recommended modules the host can support faithfully
3. justify every optional module explicitly
4. avoid claiming support for a module whose host semantics are weak or misleading

The central question is not:

"How many modules does this adapter support?"

It is:

"Which capability contract can this host support truthfully?"

---

## 7. Notes

- Module status in this document is about adapter capability design, not about launch-package governance.
- Some modules are web-specific recommendations because the host can express special behavior such as DOM reflection or CSS compilation.
- A module may be important even if it is not part of a first-user story. This document is about adapter construction quality.
