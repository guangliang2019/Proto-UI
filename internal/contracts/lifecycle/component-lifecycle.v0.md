# Component Lifecycle Contract (v0)

This document defines the **lifecycle guarantees exposed to Component Authors** (Prototype Authors) in Proto UI.

It specifies:

- callback ordering
- availability boundaries
- execution domain guarantees
- disposal semantics

This document is **normative**.

---

## Execution Domain Mapping (v0)

Proto UI exposes a coarse execution guard domain via `SystemCaps` (`__sys.domain()`).

Guard domains are **not phases**; they are **permission domains** used by modules to enforce correct API usage.

### Domains

- `"setup"`
  - Active **only while** executing inside `proto.setup(def)`
- `"runtime"`
  - Active for all execution after `setup` returns:
    - `created`
    - render
    - `mounted`
    - `updated`
    - `unmounted`
    - host-driven callbacks

### Contract (v0)

1. During `proto.setup(def)`, `__sys.domain()` MUST be `"setup"`.
2. Immediately after `setup(def)` returns (before any lifecycle callbacks or render), `__sys.domain()` MUST switch to `"runtime"`.
3. During all lifecycle callbacks (`created`, `mounted`, `updated`, `unmounted`) and render execution, `__sys.domain()` MUST be `"runtime"`.
4. During the `unmounted` callback:
   - `__sys.domain()` MUST be `"runtime"`
   - `__sys.isDisposed()` MUST be `false`
5. After the `unmounted` callback returns:
   - `__sys.isDisposed()` MUST become `true`
   - All module handles guarded by `__sys` MUST become unusable and throw.

---

## Lifecycle Callbacks

Proto UI exposes the following lifecycle callbacks to Component Authors:

- `created`
- `mounted`
- `updated`
- `unmounted`

These callbacks are registered during setup and executed by the runtime according to the canonical lifecycle timeline.

---

## Ordering Guarantees

### Setup → Created → First Render → Mounted

The runtime MUST guarantee the following order:

1. `proto.setup(def)` is executed
2. `created` callbacks are executed
3. Initial render is executed
4. First commit is performed
5. `mounted` callbacks are executed

Notes:

- `created` always runs **before** the first render.
- `mounted` always runs **after** the first commit.

---

## Update Cycle

When an update is triggered (e.g. via `run.update()`):

1. Render is executed
2. Commit is performed
3. `updated` callbacks are executed

No lifecycle callback may be reordered across these steps.

---

## Unmount & Disposal Semantics

### Unmount Callback

When a component instance is unmounted, the runtime MUST:

1. Execute `unmounted` callbacks
2. Only after all `unmounted` callbacks return, dispose the instance

### Availability During `unmounted`

During execution of `unmounted` callbacks:

- All module facades and handles MUST remain usable
- `__sys.isDisposed()` MUST be `false`

This allows teardown logic to safely access state, events, and other modules.

### After Disposal

After disposal completes:

- `__sys.isDisposed()` MUST be `true`
- Any access to module facades or handles guarded by `__sys` MUST throw an error

---

## Error Model

Lifecycle violations (ordering, availability, or domain misuse) are considered **runtime bugs**.

Implementations MUST fail fast and MUST NOT silently recover.

---

## Versioning

- Version: **v0**
- v0 guarantees ordering, availability, and domain mapping.
- Future versions may introduce additional callbacks or checkpoints but MUST NOT violate v0 guarantees.
