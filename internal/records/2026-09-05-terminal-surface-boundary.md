# Terminal Surface boundary for later Agent Harness work

Date: 2026-09-05

Status: non-normative research recommendation for #530. This record does not admit a Contract, Module, Host Capability, Prototype, Adapter relation, terminal engine, PTY backend, or implementation.

Refs: #513 (Agent Harness tracker), #514 (coverage matrix), #517 (Code Block), #521 (windowing), #530 (this research).

## Recommendation

Advance **option C: a narrow interactive Terminal Surface proposal checkpoint**. Keep the terminal emulator, mutable cell grid, escape parsing, alternate screen, scrollback, selection engine, mouse protocol, PTY/process lifecycle, transport, permissions, reconnection, and audit completely outside Proto UI portable state.

The next checkpoint should consider one semantic Module plus one lease-shaped Host Capability for low-cardinality status, focus entry/exit, committed text/key intent, character-cell resize negotiation, bounded attention/error facts, and host-owned accessibility projection. It should not admit an engine, public Prototype, or Adapter support claim yet.

This is smaller and more honest than option D, while unlike B it fulfills the first terminal-specific user job: interact with a full-screen or cursor-addressed process rather than merely read output. Option A remains the fallback for logs and static output.

Classification: **next proposal checkpoint**. The engine remains **infrastructure-exempt behind a narrow host surface**.

## Evidence and authority

### Repository authority

The following catalog entities are draft unless stated otherwise:

- `K-HOST-SURFACE-ROLES-0001-A..D` distinguishes `boundaryTarget`, `surfaceTarget`, and host-private targets/controllers. Splitting roles creates no second semantic owner or portable channel.
- `C-HOST-SURFACE-PROJECTION-0001-A/B/D/E` keeps lifecycle and logical identity at `boundaryTarget`, limits `surfaceTarget` to presentation, leaves focus/a11y/event/native targets to their domains, and requires replacement cleanup.
- `C-TEXT-CONTROL-0001-A/C/F/G/H`, `D-TEXT-CONTROL-PROJECTION-0001-A/C/D/E`, and `HC-TEXT-CONTROL-0001` are the worked precedent for portable requirements, a host-owned engine, normalized events, a bounded lease, editing-session preservation, and Web-only evidence limits. They do not authorize expanding Textarea into a terminal.
- `C-FOCUS-0001-B/C/D/G` distinguishes focus facts/requests/eligibility/topology/policy, keeps fact ownership in Focus, and lets entry regions delegate without creating Terminal-specific focused state.
- `C-A11Y-0001-B/D/E/G/H/I` and `HC-A11Y-0001` govern semantic-object name/description/state/relation facts, state-backed mode, updated name/description projection, and native/degraded host projection; Terminal patches do not form a second A11y channel.
- `C-SCROLL-0001-D/E`, `M-SCROLL-0001-D/E`, and `HC-SCROLL-SURFACE-0001-D` keep geometry and high-frequency host facts behind a lease, require released leases to stop delivery, and require stale-callback suppression and cleanup.
- Active `D-ADAPTER-PROFILE-0001-B/C/D/E` means an existing Adapter can claim Terminal Module support or Host Capability provision only after concrete reviewed evidence. Absence from an Adapter profile means uncataloged, not unsupported.

Current implementation and tests confirm those adjacent patterns:

- `packages/adapters/base/src/host/surface-projection.ts` keeps adapter-private boundary/surface mapping replaceable without owning a domain target.
- `packages/modules/text-control/src/caps.ts` expresses a data-only `attach`/`update`/`snapshot`/`dispose` lease.
- `packages/modules/text-control/test/impl-spec.test.ts` proves normalized fake-host callbacks and lease cleanup without leaking a host target.
- `T-HOST-SURFACE-PROJECTION-0001` and `T-TEXT-CONTROL-0001` bind those guarantees to executable evidence.
- Targeted searches found no Terminal Surface, PTY, or xterm implementation in `packages/**`. No `T-TERMINAL-*` evidence exists.

`apps/www/src/content/docs/en/build/host-caps.md` accurately projects the Module -> Host Capability -> Adapter split, lease lifetime, fake-host limits, and no-raw-target rule. `internal/records/2026-08-02-host-surface-projection.zh-CN.md` and `internal/records/2026-08-02-text-control-host-boundary.zh-CN.md` are context, not authority.

### External primary sources

Web evidence was inspected at xterm.js commit `c58ea3637f3968e0e6e79cd92cf9aace7ef89ee2`:

- [public typings](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/c58ea3637f3968e0e6e79cd92cf9aace7ef89ee2/typings/xterm.d.ts) expose engine-owned DOM elements and input textarea, buffer/mode state, `onData`, binary mouse reports, key interception, resize, selection, title, bell, direct rendering, and disposal. `onWriteParsed` is already coalesced to at most once per frame, while resize documentation recommends debouncing before PTY propagation.
- [AccessibilityManager](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/c58ea3637f3968e0e6e79cd92cf9aace7ef89ee2/src/browser/AccessibilityManager.ts) builds an engine-specific row list and live region, synchronizes rows with buffer/render/scroll, suppresses echoed input, stops normal announcement after 20 output rows, handles boundary focus, and disposes listeners and accessibility DOM.

Non-Web evidence was inspected in Microsoft Console and Windows Terminal sources at or before Microsoft Terminal commit `093e49e29a9f806ff83025c49be5d0c970673b00`:

- [Creating a Pseudoconsole session](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/creating-a-pseudoconsole-session) assigns bidirectional handles, buffering, VT decoding, process creation, character-cell resize, final-frame draining, and close/deadlock hazards to the host/backend integration.
- [Window and Screen Buffer Size](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/window-and-screen-buffer-size) states that VT window and screen-buffer sizes coincide and terminal scrollback belongs to the terminal rather than the addressable console area.
- [Windows Terminal selection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/selection) documents engine-specific mouse modes, keyboard mark mode, block selection, explicit copy, and input fallthrough.
- [Keyboard Selection spec](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/093e49e29a9f806ff83025c49be5d0c970673b00/doc/specs/%234993%20-%20Keyboard%20Selection/Keyboard-Selection.md) separates Terminal Control input policy from Terminal Core selection state and requires selection-change notification through UI Automation.
- [Search spec](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/093e49e29a9f806ff83025c49be5d0c970673b00/doc/specs/%23605%20-%20Search/spec.md) keeps terminal input and search-box input separate, defines focus transfer and Escape restoration in native XAML chrome, and lets the buffer/search engine own matching and selection.

These sources support a cross-host boundary, not cross-host conformance: engines own terminal protocol, buffers, selection, rendering, and platform accessibility mechanics; a narrow surface may coordinate portable facts and requests without copying those internals.

## User-job and slice comparison

| Option | User job | Benefit | Cost or failure | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. No Terminal domain | Read append-only output or a static code/log artifact. | Already has an honest path through App-authored content and the #517 Code Block composition boundary. | Cannot represent cursor addressing, alternate screen, terminal input modes, resize, or a mutable screen. | Keep as fallback; not a terminal. |
| B. Read-only terminal screen/scrollback | Inspect cursor-addressed or alternate-screen output without sending input. | Preserves visual terminal fidelity through an engine. | Pays nearly all emulator, accessibility, selection, rendering, and lifecycle cost while failing the primary interactive job. Static logs should use A. | Do not make the first Proto UI slice. A host may embed this privately as infrastructure. |
| C. Interactive input + resize | Focus a terminal, enter text/keys, observe status, and keep rows/columns synchronized. | Smallest terminal-specific end-to-end job; fakeable without raw engine values. | Requires explicit shortcut, IME, focus escape, accessibility, epoch, and cleanup policy. | **Recommended proposal checkpoint.** |
| D. Selection/search/clipboard/mouse | Operate full terminal workbench features. | Rich parity with mature terminal products. | Selection/core state, Clipboard, find UI, mouse reporting, and security policies widen several owners at once. | Defer. Preserve engine defaults where available; no portable API claim. |

## Responsibility and trust table

| Layer | Owns | Receives across the boundary | Must never expose to portable authoring |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App/backend | Runtime registry epoch + monotonic session sequence; per-session monotonic binding sequence; process/PTY/input/output lifecycle; authorization/reconnect/audit/restart. | Bounded IDs/results/actions. | Raw I/O/process/token. |
| Engine infrastructure | Parser/grid/modes/scrollback/render/A11y; atomic parser-ground reset for drop/forced close; created-vs-borrowed ownership. | Host-private routes. | Engine/target/controller/raw I/O. |
| Proto UI Terminal owner | Module session/owner/view identities; view policy/facts; bounded resize/attention results. | Plain bounded values + Focus. | Grid/raw I/O/host objects/engine ownership/process authority. |
| Terminal Host Capability | Bounded registry; bind/replace/close; channel preflight/fail-closed; parser reset; owner exact identity; one view; resize latest slot/high watermark/facts; bounded attention; child cleanup/borrowed detach. | Immutable structured IDs, requests/results/callbacks/resolvers. | No raw I/O/leases authoring; no unbounded tombstones/queues/allocations. |
| Adapter profile | Materialize targets, wire capability/lifecycle/Focus. | Governed requirement after evidence. | No semantic reinterpretation/support claim early. |
| Composition | Chrome/status/controls/attention presentation. | App facts/events. | Terminal protocol/process/grid/selection. |

Engine remains infrastructure. Session IDs use registry epoch/sequence with 64-session bound; binding/request sequences use scalar high watermarks. Bind exact retry live only. Binding replacement reserves and revokes old input immediately, then preflights next channels/parser capability before mutating old output/parser; failure restores input. Exact retry returns same Promise/result; overlap rejects. Drain has 30s parser-safe fallback. Close also 30s, with explicit reset failure/borrowed quarantine. Owner retry includes callback identity. Resize caps 1024x512/product262144.

## Portable facts, requests, and information paths

### Candidate first-slice values

The proposal may evaluate these plain values; names are illustrative and not an admitted API:

- App input: current registry epoch/monotonic process session sequence; monotonic per-session binding sequence; status/policy. Module mints connection/instance IDs.
- View facts: attachment/composition/applied effective dimensions/support. Session/binding/attention and owner resize results bounded/correlated.
- Requests: bind/replace/close, owner/view/key/resize. Physical I/O private. Focus remains Focus.

Dimensions must be positive integers within first-slice profile: columns 1..1024, rows 1..512, product <=262144. Reject invalid/out-of-range before engine/backend allocation; never clamp by allocating first. Module resize revision is positive safe strictly increasing per instance. Owner holds one in-flight + one latest slot; replacement emits superseded. During release retained slot immediately rejects owner-released and in-flight settles before grant. Facts expose only last applied effective dimensions/revision.

A current accessible text snapshot can be a plain diagnostic/test result, but should not be continuously copied into portable State. The first slice should expose `host-bridge | bounded-snapshot | unavailable` support and prefer a host-owned accessibility bridge. Any later author-facing snapshot request requires a separate privacy, size, cadence, and stale-revision decision.

Selection summaries and copy requests are technically expressible as plain values, but are not needed by option C. The engine keeps default selection/copy behavior. No selected text or Clipboard payload enters portable State. Programmatic selection, search, Clipboard, mouse reporting, and hyperlinks remain option D.

### Information paths

| Input | Owner path | Observable output | Synchronization boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Session bind | structured session+initial binding -> Host preflight | Exact live existing or bounded failure. Registry memory bounded by 64 concurrent entries + scalar watermark; old epoch stale. | Current registry epoch/session sequence/binding sequence. |
| Binding replace | Correlated request sequence/ID + expected/next binding | Exact retry same pending/result; changed reuse conflict; one newer pending rejects. Reservation revokes old input immediately. Channel/reset preflight failure restores input and old current; output drain deadline falls back to revoke-reset; unexpected failure closes/null. | Request/binding high watermarks; bounded last-result cache; current binding nullable after retirement. |
| Process close | revoke input; drain output up to 30s; on deadline revoke/drop and parser-ground reset; cascade children; attention; engine disposition | Never hangs. Final drain or explicit forced disposition. | Close request ID/deadline; created dispose/borrowed detach. |
| Output/input | Session output gate; active-view input | Reconnect safe; no raw portable. | Binding sequence. |
| Geometry/resize | View geometry -> Module validated capped dimensions/revision -> owner | One in-flight+latest; owner result survives view. Release rejects retained slot owner-released and waits in-flight terminal. Facts only applied effective. | OwnerConnection ID + monotonic revision + 1024x512/product cap. |
| Focus/A11y | System domains -> active view over session engine | View-only projection, engine persists. | View epochs. |
| Attention | Session engine -> bounded consecutive runs -> `onAttentionBatch` | Normal batches preserve run order/count; fixed pending capacity. Overflow batch preserves sequence range and bell/error counts while explicitly losing interleaving; no unbounded callback/queue. | Contiguous session sequences; callback retired only after drain; presentation dedupe downstream. |

A fake fixes registry/session/binding/dimension bounds and injects channel/parser/EOF failures. Exercise:

1. capacity/identity/bind/owner/attention basics;
2. start binding replace r1 and hold drain. Call close c1: synchronously mark closing, revoke/preflight next channels, settle r1 rejected session-closing with still-draining current binding ID, release replacement reservation, and prove r1 cannot later activate. Close then drains current binding;
3. during close before binding retirement, replace r2 returns rejected session-closing with non-null current ID. After retirement but before cascade completion returns unavailable session-closing/current null; after completion session-closed/null;
4. exact close c1 retry returns same pending Promise/cached result. Concurrent close c2 returns correlated already-closing with requestId c2, originalRequestId c1, and current nullable binding without second cascade. After completion c3 returns already-closed with c3/original c1 and cached dispositions. No caller receives another request ID as its own;
5. graceful EOF with borrowed engine ending in partial CSI/OSC: verify parser ground; if not, reset before detached-borrowed. Inject reset failure: closed-with-error/eof-parser-reset-failed/quarantined-borrowed; external owner must reset/recreate. Created engine disposes. Never-EOF uses forced reset success/failure similarly;
6. binding exact retry/overlap/input revoke/channel failure/deadline/parser reset; session/owner resize dimension cases;
7. private input/Focus/mouse/F6/support/restart; no raw values.

If implemented as specified, this plan would verify close-versus-replacement settlement, nullable draining/retired binding results, per-caller close idempotency, graceful-EOF borrowed parser safety, and prior Terminal capacity/binding/resize/lifecycle invariants. This record supplies no executable `T-TERMINAL-*` evidence.

## Input, shortcut, and focus policy

- **IME/private input:** physical input never Module/event/log; active view checks policy/current session binding and writes once. No view/closing session rejects. App key request outbound only.
- **Mode/process:** exit revokes input immediately while output binding stays `drain-to-eof` until EOF/queued parse/attention settle. Reconnect uses `replaceBinding`; restart new session. Read-only/disabled and Focus eligibility explicit.
- **Key versus text:** committed Unicode uses text; bounded non-text/modifier keys use `TerminalKey`. Letter/digit key intents require Ctrl/Alt/Meta; unmodified/Shift-only printable input uses text. Unsupported keys defer; no host event/raw encoding crosses.
- **Shortcut order:** configured Harness command wins before engine; other accepted keys fall through once. Host reports whether required F6/Shift+F6 reservation is available.
- **Escape route ownership:** bare Escape is terminal input. Host reports `keyboardRoute`; composition owns/requires reachable enabled leave Button and Focus topology. Either failure blocks composed acceptance.
- **Ctrl/Meta/Alt:** no blanket interception; only registered Harness chords stay local.
- **Paste:** App/host owns Clipboard/policy; committed paste routes only in interactive mode. Paths are text, not authority.
- **Pointer/mouse:** first slice requires Host suppression of engine terminal mouse reports even if the process enables them; pointer events produce zero backend writes while engine-local selection may remain. Custom mouse reporting is option D.
- **Mobile/virtual keyboard:** tapping may request host IME in interactive/read-only as appropriate. App-composed special-key Button uses `requestKey`; engine encodes only in interactive mode. Otherwise zero backend writes or explicit unavailable.

## Accessibility boundary

- The A11y domain supplies accessible name/description/mode to the resolved terminal target; App/Module facts and composition report independent connection/process/display status, focus entry, and the reliable exit control. Terminal patches do not duplicate A11y naming.
- The engine/Host Capability owns the mutable screen representation, cursor/selection mapping, row navigation, terminal modes, and platform accessibility API. Proto UI does not set a generic `textbox`, `application`, or `log` role for every terminal host.
- Streaming grid stays engine-local. Attention delivery is bounded: profile limits runs per batch and pending batches; normal batches preserve contiguous ordered runs, overflow preserves first/last sequence plus bell/error totals and explicitly signals interleaving loss. App presentation may further dedupe effects; callback count/memory remain bounded.
- Engine-local keyboard selection and copy remain available when the host supports them. Any composition-provided Copy/Search control is a separately admitted ordinary Proto UI control invoking a host/App request; selected text and Clipboard contents stay outside portable state.
- Zoom/reflow/font metrics/glyph width/contrast/screen-reader row geometry remain host/engine. `columns`, `rows`, and `appliedResizeRevision` expose only last applied effective result; clamped effective becomes fact, rejected/superseded/observed geometry preserves prior fact. Reduced-motion presentation does not alter attention batch.
- A non-Web profile may use UI Automation or another native accessibility API and may degrade explicitly. Passing WC/React/Vue tests on the Web host cannot establish non-Web conformance.

## Performance, scrollback, and lifecycle

### High-frequency threshold

The portable content threshold is zero grid diffs. Lifecycle/support/binding/resize results are ordered. Attention is not one callback/event: bounded batches preserve ordered consecutive runs; overflow is an explicit bounded degradation with sequence range/counts. Only equivalent level facts coalesce. Physical input has no observation.

No portable Module receives `onRender`, `onWriteParsed`, buffer lines, dirty rectangles, glyph runs, or scroll positions. This avoids allocation/copy churn and prevents adapter profiles from re-litigating a grid schema.

Terminal scrollback is engine-owned. #521 windowed Collection applies to authored logical lists/logs, not a terminal buffer, cursor-addressed screen, alternate screen, or selection. A later App-exported immutable log snapshot may use Code Block/windowing after it leaves terminal semantics; that does not move live scrollback into Collection.

### Lifecycle rules

- Registry/bind/capacity/affinity IDs bounded/exact.
- Binding exact retry/one pending/input revoke/preflight/deadline/reset/fail-closed as specified. When close starts, it cancels and terminally settles pending replacement as session-closing, releases reservation, and forbids later activation before close drain.
- replaceBinding during close reports session-closing with current non-null while draining; after retirement reports nullable unavailable; after close session-closed/null.
- Close idempotency is request-aware: exact request ID shares Promise/result; different ID during close gets correlated already-closing referencing original without cascade; different ID after gets already-closed with cached disposition. Only original performs teardown.
- Close cascade orders view/owner/replacement cancellation/output/attention. Borrowed engine parser must be ground even after graceful EOF; reset failure quarantines with eof-parser-reset-failed. Forced close has analogous disposition; created engine may dispose.
- Owner/resize/dimension facts and view/session input/Focus/A11y/attention/restart remain exact.

## Proposed entity and evidence graph

If a maintainer accepts semantic admission in a later checkpoint, the smallest coherent graph is:

```text
C-TERMINAL-SURFACE-0001 (draft contract)
  <- satisfied by M-TERMINAL-SURFACE-0001
       -> requires HC-TERMINAL-SURFACE-0001
  <- verified by T-TERMINAL-SURFACE-0001

K-HOST-SURFACE-ROLES-0001
C-HOST-SURFACE-PROJECTION-0001
C-FOCUS-0001 / C-A11Y-0001
  <- referenced/depended on by the new contract as applicable

A-REACT-18-19-0001
  -> may later support M-TERMINAL-SURFACE-0001 and provide
     HC-TERMINAL-SURFACE-0001 only after reviewed Web evidence
```

No new Adapter identity is justified: React Web already has `A-REACT-18-19-0001`; a later non-Web implementation must bind to its own concrete profile. No public Prototype is justified by this research alone. Prototype identity/anatomy and composition chrome require a separate admitted authoring slice after the Module/Host Capability boundary is accepted.

### Bounded red-first plan

1. **Portable negatives:** no raw I/O/engine/leases/input observation; bounded IDs.
2. **Session/binding:** capacity/identity; close cancels pending replacement; replace during draining/retired/closed gives non-null/null exact result; no late activation.
3. **Close idempotency/parser:** exact-ID shared; different-ID already-closing/already-closed correlated; EOF partial parser reset; borrowed quarantine on graceful/forced reset failure; child cascade.
4. **Binding operations:** retry/overlap/input revoke/preflight/deadline/fail-closed.
5. **Owner/resize/attention:** owner release/retained/in-flight; caps/revisions/facts; bounded attention.
6. **Input/systems:** private input/modes/mouse/Focus/A11y/restart.
7. **Real Web evidence to implement:** close/replace race and per-ID calls; EOF parser partial/failure; forced close; binding/owner/resize/attention cleanup.
8. **Cross-adapter Web only if claimed:** one source remains Web evidence.
9. **Non-Web:** independent native session/binding/parser/close/quarantine/resize/input/A11y evidence.

## #513/#514 matrix consumption

PR #563 currently carries the intended authoritative file `internal/agent-harness/dogfood-coverage-matrix.md`, but it is not on `main`, is conflicting, and has an active `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review. This record must not copy that full matrix or create a second source of truth.

When the matrix carrier lands, a follow-up #530 carrier must update exactly these rows:

- `harness.future.terminal-chrome`: replace the pending-owner text with the option-C recommendation; keep state `research` until semantic admission, link this record as current evidence, name the proposed Module/Host Capability checkpoint, and trigger re-review on admission outcome, input/selection/mouse scope expansion, or a non-Web claim.
- `harness.future.terminal-engine`: retain `infrastructure-exempt`; replace “pending #530 ruling” with the settled exemption for engine/PTY/grid/scrollback/selection internals; state that engine selection, executable backend binding, message/input scope expansion, or ownership leakage triggers re-review.
- Recompute only the matrix totals if a state changes. This record recommends no state-count change yet.

#513 should receive a link to the landed record and matrix carrier; #514 remains the owner of the single matrix document. Until that projection lands, #530 is advanced rather than closed.

## Acceptance mapping

- Responsibility table covers App/backend, engine, Proto UI semantic owner, Host Capability/Adapter, and composition/design language, including trust exclusions.
- Options A-D are compared; C is the smallest admissible proposal and D is explicitly deferred.
- Input/shortcut/IME, accessibility, resize, performance, scrollback/windowing, lifecycle, and cleanup are bounded above.
- Code Block remains an honest static/log fallback; Textarea remains a plain-text control. Neither is expanded.
- No raw terminal engine, PTY, transport, target, buffer, grid, or host object enters portable authoring.
- The conclusion is one `next proposal checkpoint`; no materially different viable owner remains unresolved in this packet.
- The exact #513/#514 matrix rows and re-review triggers are identified; landing them remains the next #530 carrier because their authoritative file is not yet on `main`.

## Residual risks and smallest human decision

Residual risks: accessible terminal behavior varies substantially by engine/platform; terminal keymaps conflict with Harness commands; resize and Unicode cell-width behavior are engine-specific; a future engine may not expose a clean injected backend sink; sensitive input and screen text may make diagnostic snapshots inappropriate.

Smallest later human decision: accept or reject admission of the proposed `C-*` / `M-*` / `HC-*` / `T-*` graph for option C with the exclusions above. Acceptance would authorize a separate spec proposal, not an engine choice or implementation. Rejection leaves option A plus private infrastructure embedding and ordinary Proto UI chrome.
