# Text Document / Editor Surface boundary for later Agent Harness work

Date: 2026-09-05

Status: non-normative research recommendation for #531. This record does not admit a Contract, Module, Host Capability, Prototype, Adapter relation, editor engine, document model, language service, persistence path, or implementation.

Refs: #389 (Text Control/Input), #513 (Agent Harness tracker), #514 (coverage matrix), #517 (Code Block), #521 (windowing), #529 (Artifact Workspace/static Diff Review), #531 (this research).

## Recommendation

Advance **option C: a narrow single-document plain-text Editor Surface proposal checkpoint**. Keep the document model, text storage, edit application, undo/redo stack, selection objects, tokenization, viewport rendering, decorations, language services, workers, and host accessibility implementation inside an infrastructure-exempt editor engine. Keep file identity, source revision, persistence, permissions, save/revert, conflicts, audit, and diagnostics truth App-owned.

The next checkpoint should consider one semantic Module plus one lease-shaped Host Capability for an opaque document/revision reference, attachment/read-only/status facts, revision-bound transaction summaries, bounded selection summaries, engine-command requests, Focus-domain integration, Module-owned connection identities, and stale-result suppression. It should not admit an editor engine, public Prototype, syntax/diagnostic semantics, multi-document workbench, or Adapter support claim.

Classification: **next proposal checkpoint**. The editor/document engine remains **infrastructure-exempt behind a narrow host surface**.

Option A remains the honest fallback for small unrevisioned plain text (`P-BASE-TEXTAREA`), structural code/log presentation (#517), and immutable diff review (#529). Option B pays editor/model/accessibility cost but adds little beyond those fallbacks. Option C is the first slice with an editor-specific user job: maintain one revisioned editing session with engine-owned selection and undo while the App remains persistence authority.

## Evidence and authority

### Repository authority

The following catalog entities are draft unless stated otherwise:

- `C-TEXT-CONTROL-0001-A/C/F/G/I`, `M-TEXT-CONTROL-0001`, and `HC-TEXT-CONTROL-0001` govern one host-selected single- or multiline plain-text control, normalized value/input/composition behavior, and a bounded host lease. They do not govern a revisioned document, editor transactions, model lifetime, undo, decorations, or language services.
- `D-TEXT-CONTROL-PROJECTION-0001-A/C/D/E` keeps selection, cursor, IME, software keyboard, edit menus, and system editing chrome host-owned and limits current conformance to Web hosts. `D-TEXT-CONTROL-PROJECTION-0001-Q-SELECTION` already owns the open question of when selection facts/requests enter the plain Text Control contract.
- `P-BASE-TEXTAREA-PHYSICAL-TARGET`, `P-BASE-TEXTAREA-EVENTS-AND-IME`, and `P-BASE-TEXTAREA-BOUNDARY` define a contentless multiline leaf and explicitly exclude rich text, system selection/edit-menu ownership, auto-resize, and a second editor.
- `P-BASE-INPUT-PHYSICAL-TARGET` and `P-BASE-INPUT-BOUNDARY` make the same negative boundary for single-line text entry. Merged PR #547 generalized the shared Text Control line-mode implementation without adding document semantics.
- `K-HOST-SURFACE-ROLES-0001-D` and `C-HOST-SURFACE-PROJECTION-0001-B/D/E` keep raw targets/controllers in translation and require logical-boundary stability plus replacement cleanup.
- `C-FOCUS-0001`, `C-A11Y-0001`, and `C-SCROLL-0001` retain focus, accessibility semantic projection, and logical scrolling ownership. An Editor Surface may consume these domains but may not copy their state machines.
- Active `D-ADAPTER-PROFILE-0001-B/C/D/E` prohibits inferring reviewed Module support or Host Capability provision from a package or same-Web evidence.

Current source and tests confirm the adjacent boundary:

- `packages/core/src/text-control.ts` exposes line-mode patches, normalized editing/composition events, and only value/composition snapshots.
- `packages/modules/text-control/src/caps.ts` uses a data-only `attach`/`update`/`snapshot`/`dispose` lease.
- `packages/modules/text-control/src/web.ts` keeps concrete Web targets, listeners, selection preservation, scroll offsets, and IME mechanics in the host bridge.
- `packages/modules/text-control/test/impl-spec.test.ts` proves value, IME, and lease behavior through a fake host.
- `T-TEXT-CONTROL-0001`, `T-BASE-TEXTAREA-0001`, and `T-BASE-INPUT-0001` bind the current leaf-control evidence. No `T-TEXT-DOCUMENT-*` or `T-EDITOR-SURFACE-*` evidence exists.
- Targeted searches found no Text Document/Editor Surface, CodeMirror, Monaco `ITextModel`, or comparable editor implementation in `packages/**` or `apps/www/src/**`.

`internal/records/2026-08-02-text-control-host-boundary.zh-CN.md` explains the host-owned plain-text boundary. `internal/records/2026-08-29-code-block-composition-first-slice-design.md` keeps code, highlighting, selection, and Clipboard outside Code Block. Issue #529 keeps immutable diff computation, revisions, patch semantics, and side effects App-owned. These are context or scoped work, not authority to admit an editor.

### External primary sources

Web evidence was inspected from Monaco Editor:

- [README at `d620ca0c03d24a51c05ae4dca8a9d5923a4aeb9c`](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/d620ca0c03d24a51c05ae4dca8a9d5923a4aeb9c/README.md) separates file-like models, URI identity, text content/edit history, DOM editor views, language-feature providers, workers, and disposal.
- [public `monaco.d.ts` at gh-pages `b86a4f9e56a3228b067578205655e2307ae89d44`](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/b86a4f9e56a3228b067578205655e2307ae89d44/node_modules/monaco-editor/monaco.d.ts) gives models distinct IDs/URIs and version IDs; exposes range-based change events, selections, composition, paste, focus, layout, scroll, hidden areas, serializable view state, multi-cursor behavior, decorations, accessibility page size, and `tabFocusMode`; and represents listeners as disposables.
- [Accessibility Guide for Integrators](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/wiki/Accessibility-Guide-for-Integrators) requires host-provided action keybindings, an accessible label, high-contrast decisions, screen-reader support configuration, and accessibility help. It records that wrapping may need host/engine adaptation for screen readers.

Non-Web evidence was inspected from current Microsoft native-editor documentation:

- [WinUI RichEditBox guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/develop/ui/controls/rich-edit-box), source revision `fd2cde64baabeded5e3cf17f33b8787c9e468691`, separates the editor control from surrounding toolbar/file controls and exposes an `ITextDocument` for content, ranges, selection, undo/redo, loading, and saving.
- [RichEditTextDocument](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/microsoft.ui.text.richedittextdocument), source revision `70ebf766b73dd46f874ded9cfcf5b01d4476048d`, owns selection, undo grouping/history, ranges, streams, text, formatting, and display-update batching.
- [UI Automation TextPattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-textpattern-overview), source revision `156931bb4ec1e81b028c76ea983553f2e9778bdd`, exposes document text as ranges with selection/change events and platform navigation. It warns that ranges may become invalid after replacement, accessibility text is broadly readable by clients, and range access has cross-process performance costs.

The Web and native engines differ, but both keep models, selections, rendering, input services, accessibility ranges, and resource lifetime behind engine/platform APIs. That supports a data-only host surface, not a generic portable document model or a multi-host conformance claim.

## User-job and slice comparison

| Option | User job | Benefit | Cost or failure | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. No editor domain | Edit a small plain-text value or read code/log/diff output. | Existing Textarea, Code Block, and static Diff boundaries remain honest and cheap. | No document revision, engine undo, durable selection, viewport restoration, or large-document session. | Keep as fallback. |
| B. Read-only document viewport with selection/copy | Navigate a document through an editor engine without editing. | Can preserve engine-native selection and accessibility ranges. | Pays model/view/a11y/lifecycle cost while overlapping Code Block/static document/diff paths; no first editor-specific editing job. | Do not make the first Proto UI slice. Private infrastructure may provide it. |
| C. Single-document plain-text Editor Surface | Maintain one revisioned editor session, apply engine-local edits/undo, and route explicit App actions. | Smallest end-to-end editor-specific job; fakeable through references and transaction summaries. | Requires revision, shortcut/IME, permission, selection-summary, view-state, and stale-callback rules. | **Recommended proposal checkpoint.** |
| D. Syntax/decorations/diagnostics | Inspect tokens, decorations, diagnostics, quick fixes, and navigation. | Useful developer experience. | Adds language-service truth, decoration identity, issue navigation, and accessibility policy. | Defer. |
| E. Multi-document/large-document workbench | Manage tabs, models, huge files, paging, branches, conflicts, and workspace commands. | Full workbench. | Conflates App workspace, persistence, windowing, editor, language, and conflict owners. | Defer. |

## Responsibility and trust table

| Layer or existing surface | Owns | Receives across the boundary | Must never expose or claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App/backend | Opaque document/file identity; authoritative source revision; permissions; loading; persistence; save/revert; conflict and idempotency; language-service and diagnostics truth; audit. | Document/transaction references and explicit data-only action requests. | File handles, storage streams, credentials, VCS objects, language-server handles, authority inferred from rendered text. |
| Editor-engine infrastructure | Mutable text model; edit application; composition; selection/cursors; undo/redo; tokenization; decorations; folding; find; viewport rendering/physics/internal line windowing; view state; native text ranges/caret implementation. | Host-local target plus model/backend services injected outside portable authoring. | Engine/model/view/controller/worker, mutable ranges, DOM/native target, semantic role, logical Focus/Scroll ownership, framework component, host view-state object. |
| Proto UI Text Document semantic owner | One logical surface identity; composite document/model-session/source/content/mutation identity; lease epoch; attachment/read-only/input-enabled facts; commit-stamped transaction authorization context; revision-bound transaction observations; bounded composition/selection availability; engine-command correlation; stale UI rejection. It consumes Focus identity/view epoch and resolved Scroll facts/requests rather than owning them. | Immutable references, status facts, summaries, and requests. | Full document, raw changes/models, focus facts, Scroll support/geometry/physics, tokenizer/diagnostic objects, raw events, persistence authority, engine undo data. |
| Text Document Host Capability | Resolve model by composite `{ documentId, modelSessionId }`, underlying App document service by `documentId`, and current target/view from host configuration; attach engine; bridge IME/keyboard; stamp initiating view/policy context at commit; expose targets/controllers to Focus/Scroll/A11y integration; apply read-only policy; emit bounded view facts; preserve view state; clean up. | Static requirement and mutable patch plus adapter-injected resolvers keyed by opaque IDs. | No target/model/editor/range/selection/file/stream/worker/callback source returned to portable authoring; no semantic focus, role, or logical Scroll support ownership. |
| Adapter profile | Materialize boundary/surface/input/a11y targets; wire capability; translate lifecycle and Focus participation. | Governed Module requirement only after admission. | No semantic reinterpretation and no support/provision relation before profile evidence. |
| Composition/design language | Tabs/breadcrumbs, toolbar, filename/revision/status, dirty/conflict badge, explicit Save/Revert, find controls if later admitted, diagnostics list if later admitted. | App facts and ordinary Proto UI control events. | Document storage/model, edit transactions, undo stack, language/diagnostic truth, direct engine action during render. |
| Base Textarea | Small unrevisioned multiline plain-text value protocol. | Value/property facts and normalized input/IME. | Document identity/revision, transactions, engine model, multi-cursor, workbench. |
| Code Block | Structural presentation of App-authored code/log content. | Authored text/tokens and ordinary child controls. | Editing, selection, Clipboard, document history, language services. |
| Static Diff Review | App-local immutable change presentation and explicit review actions. | App-computed diff/revision labels. | Edit model, patch application, persistence, conflict resolution. |

The engine can remain completely outside Proto UI. Host configuration resolves the model by the composite opaque key `{ documentId, modelSessionId }` and the underlying App document service by `documentId`; neither member is assumed globally unique by itself, and no engine or document object crosses portable authoring.

## Portable facts, requests, and information paths

### Candidate first-slice values

Names below illustrate a proposal; they are not an admitted API:

- App input: immutable stable `surfaceId` plus `document: { documentId, modelSessionId }`; the composite pair is the model key, and the model-session service owns source/saved content. Mutable resolved `editingMode: interactive | read-only | disabled` and status policy crosses per view. Role/name/description remain A11y; help is composition/relation.
- Host facts: attachment/policy/facts revisions; source/mutation/equality; structurally coupled edit input+origin support; delivery capacity; composition/selection/keyboard/A11y/view support. Module dirty from identity. Interactive mode is admissible only with `support.edit` available+commit-stamped and delivery available.
- Persist summary alone carries delivery epoch/sequence/transaction ID, exact private record, Host origin. App-origin observe-only summary carries observation ID but consumes no delivery coordinate/acknowledgement. One in-flight; retry/rejection/handoff explicit.
- Commands include applied/no-op/busy/rejected/unavailable. Before any input/undo/redo mutation, Host reserves private queue capacity; otherwise text pauses and command returns bounded delivery-backpressure without engine execution. Save/Revert composition-aware barriers.

`contentIdentity` is an opaque model-service equality token, not a monotonic engine version: within one composite model session, equal full document contents MUST yield the same token and unequal contents MUST yield different tokens. `savedContentIdentity` is the token of the current saved source. Mutation revision still increases on every edit/undo/replacement, so edit then undo to byte-for-byte saved text produces a newer mutation revision but restores `contentIdentity === savedContentIdentity` and dirty false. The engine/model service computes the token without copying full content through Proto UI.

The first slice's selection summary is intentionally bounded to `{ count, primaryCollapsed }` plus the current monotonic mutation revision. No raw range, selected text, mutable selection, pixel rectangle, or ungoverned line/column encoding crosses. A later line/column or range API needs an explicit Unicode position encoding and revision semantics.

This resolves the seam with `D-TEXT-CONTROL-PROJECTION-0001-Q-SELECTION` without closing it: plain Text Control selection remains that decision's open question. Revision-bound document selection is a different future contract and must not be retrofitted into `TextControlHandle`. Neither surface gains `selectAll`, `setSelection`, or `replaceSelection` in this first slice.

### Information paths

| Input | Owner path | Observable output | Synchronization boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document/model identity | App -> immutable Text Document requirement -> Host Capability resolver | Correct shared/private model and view appear even when different documents reuse a locally scoped session ID. | Resolve model by composite `{ documentId, modelSessionId }`; use `documentId` alone only for the underlying App document service. |
| Source content/revision | App model-session service -> engine/model dispatcher | Engine renders text and all attached views observe one current persisted base. | Composite document/model session owns source revision and changes once for all its views. |
| Input/commit | Host bridge -> edit/origin+delivery gate -> private store/dispatcher | Interactive only when `support.edit.input=available`, origin=commit-stamped, delivery=available. Capacity reserved before engine mutation. Origin loss first blocks input/resolves read-only; no edit without provenance. | Structural edit support + policy + queue slot + composition/delivery epochs. |
| Persist delivery | Dispatcher -> App ack/outbox | Only persist summaries consume delivery key/sequence and retain payload. Observe-only App replacement uses observationId, updates model baseline as specified, and never changes sequence/watermark or awaits ack. | Full delivery key only for persist; scalar epoch/watermark. |
| Undo/Redo | Host -> same edit/origin/delivery gate -> engine | Queue slot reserved before mutation; full queue returns `busy: delivery-backpressure`, no command queue/engine change. Other outcomes exact. | Caller explicitly retries after higher facts revision reports delivery available. |
| Final model-session disposal | App-owned dispatcher lease -> terminal ack or durable outbox handoff | Retryable in-flight and queued exact records transfer atomically with same delivery keys/payloads; durable receipt permits local close. Outbox-unavailable returns blocked and retains model/records. | Idempotent handoff receipt; never drop locally committed durable intent. |
| Selection/caret | Engine | Native accessibility exposes ranges; when supported, Proto receives only count/collapsed summary; unsupported summary is explicit and carries no selection fact. | Monotonic facts and selection revisions within connection/policy; engine selection remains usable independently. |
| Focus/Tab escape | Host arbiter: active/conservative IME -> required Focus exit route -> ordinary Harness shortcut -> editor | Exactly one focus destination; at least one policy-verified exit key/chord cannot be captured by Harness/editor; facts return only through Focus. | `DocumentKeyboardRouteSupport.shortcutPolicyId` equals applied patch policy; route recomputed on every shortcut-policy update, plus Focus identity/view epoch. |
| Accessible role/naming | A11y semantic object -> HC-A11Y/Adapter -> editor target | One role/name/description projection; App help control uses existing relations. | A11y identity and target replacement; engine supplies native implementation, not role truth. |
| Viewport/scroll | Text Document registers one logical Scroll surface; M-SCROLL/HC-SCROLL-SURFACE map requests/facts to editor controller | Portable logical scroll facts/requests; engine retains physics/rendering/internal line windowing. | Scroll view epoch plus host-local geometry/controller; no raw view state. |
| Diagnostics/decorations | App language service -> later engine/composition slice | Deferred. | No first-slice channel. |

```

1. attach composite models; versioned pending facts. Before policy use null/null command. After numeric-policy attachment failure with no model baseline, use number/null request and receive numeric-policy runtime unavailable without fabricating mutation revision or engine access;
2. view A composition active blocks sibling B command. Attach view C with composition reporting unavailable: aggregate unprovableViewCount increments; interactive mode is rejected/resolved read-only or unavailable, and commands/Save remain composition-active blocked until C is noninteractive and Host confirms cancellation/epoch settlement. No null composing value is treated inactive;
3. noninteractive transitions close epoch before cancellation; Revert all views; Save waits aggregate active+unprovable+unsettled counts all zero;
4. mode admission tests keyboard route/disabled A11y and exact behaviors;
5. acknowledgement duplicate order and full delivery/rejection/Save/Revert/outbox cases;
6. switch stable surface S from `{docA,model1}` to `{docB,model1}`. Dispose A with retain-for-document and store view state only under exact `{surfaceId:S, documentId:docA, modelSessionId:model1}`. B attach uses distinct key and cannot restore A selection/folding/scroll. Switching back restores A only. evict-surface purges all S keys;
7. view/system cleanup; no raw values.

If implemented as specified, this evidence plan would verify conservative unprovable composition gating, document-keyed view retention, mode/admission, duplicate/reconciliation/barriers, and delivery/system ownership. This record supplies no executable `T-TEXT-DOCUMENT-*` evidence and claims no completed proof.

## Revision, input, shortcut, and permission policy

- **Command revision and acknowledgement:** three revision branches. Ack ordering: retired epoch ignore; current sequence <= acknowledgedThrough duplicate ignore; exact in-flight process; future/wrong ID reconcile.
- **Model-wide composition:** aggregate active, **unprovable**, and unsettled counts by model/connection/epoch. Any nonzero blocks every command and Save as composition-active. Reporting-unavailable can never support interactive mode in first slice; resolve read-only/unavailable and confirm cancellation/epoch settlement. Null is never inactive. Dispose/stale clears matching epoch only. Revert closes/cancels all.
- **Cancellation:** block input; close/increment epoch before Host cancel; reentrant/late reject; separate ack.
- **Mode/Focus/A11y/keyboard:** interactive requires edit/origin/delivery + composition reporting available + route/Leave. Read-only Focus/A11y/selection-copy no mutation; reporting unavailable allowed only after no active candidate. Disabled Focus-ineligible/no interaction/readable A11y. Route/A11y failures representable.
- **Rejection and barriers:** full atomic rejection reconciliation. Save waits composition counts zero and exactly rebases source/saved. Revert cancels/drains, observe-only replaces, clears history, rotates delivery/resets all heads.
- **View-state lifetime:** `retain-for-document` key is exact `{surfaceId, documentId, modelSessionId}` from immutable requirement. Document/session change never reads another key. `evict-surface` purges all keys for surface. Raw ranges/state never cross.

## Accessibility boundary

- A11y owns role/name/state. Disabled ready requires readable provider/range; numeric attachment failure union includes accessibility-unavailable.
- Interactive/read-only Focus eligibility also requires current policy-verified keyboard exit plus Leave control; route failure is representable attachment unavailable before entry/current focus transfers out. Disabled no entry route.
- Read-only selection/copy/navigation; disabled no user interaction, still readable.
- Web evidence must cover route loss/collision before and during focus, disabled A11y failure, sibling composition, reentrant cancellation, exact modes/layout/replacement.
- Native evidence may use UIA TextPattern or equivalent; sensitive content projection is App/Host privacy. Degradation explicit.
- Large-document accessibility and range-query performance are option E. Same-Web WC/React/Vue results cannot establish native-host conformance.

## Performance, viewport, windowing, and lifecycle

- Private payload/delivery/outbox rules exact; ack duplicate order explicit.
- Model composition aggregate includes unprovable views; interactive requires reporting available; nonzero counts gate commands/Save; cancellation ordered.
- Rejection/Save/Revert exact. Mode Focus/keyboard/A11y exact.
- View state keyed exact surface+document+model; identity switch isolates, surface eviction purges.
- Scroll/view/App lifetimes distinct; facts/support/dirty ownership exact.

## Proposed entity and evidence graph

If a maintainer later accepts semantic admission, the smallest coherent graph is:

```text
C-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001 (draft contract)
  <- satisfied by M-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001
       -> requires HC-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001
  <- verified by T-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001

K-HOST-SURFACE-ROLES-0001
C-HOST-SURFACE-PROJECTION-0001
C-FOCUS-0001 / C-A11Y-0001
C-SCROLL-0001 / M-SCROLL-0001 / HC-SCROLL-SURFACE-0001
D-TEXT-CONTROL-PROJECTION-0001-Q-SELECTION (related seam, not replaced)

A-REACT-18-19-0001
  -> may later support/provide the new Module/Host Capability only after
     reviewed Web evidence
```

No new Adapter identity is justified: existing profiles receive reviewed relations only after evidence. No public Prototype is justified by this research alone. Prototype identity/anatomy and editor chrome require a later admitted authoring slice. Text Control remains unchanged; the document selection contract is related but separate.

### Bounded red-first plan

1. **Portable negatives:** raw private/view-state values absent; bounded IDs only.
2. **Composition/modes:** active/unprovable/unsettled aggregate; reporting-unavailable forced noninteractive; sibling command/Save gates; pre-cancel epoch; route/disabled A11y semantics.
3. **Delivery/reconciliation:** three commands; duplicate order; persist/retry/outbox; full rejection; exact Save/Revert.
4. **View identity:** retain exact `{surface,document,model}` across A->B->A; no cross-document restore; evict surface all keys; Scroll/A11y/Focus cleanup.
5. **Real Web evidence to implement:** unreportable composition, sibling gates, identity-switched view state, mode/admission, duplicate/reconciliation/barrier/delivery/system cases.
6. **Performance evidence to implement:** bounded document without full copies/retained listeners/models.
7. **Cross-adapter Web only if claimed:** WC/React/Vue remains Web evidence.
8. **Non-Web:** independent native input/selection/revision/A11y/view replacement/cleanup evidence.

## #513/#514 matrix consumption

PR #563 carries `internal/agent-harness/dogfood-coverage-matrix.md`, but it is not on `main`, is conflicting, and has an active `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review. This record must not copy that matrix or create a second source of truth.

After the matrix carrier lands, a follow-up #531 carrier must update exactly:

- `harness.future.editor-chrome`: replace pending ownership with the option-C recommendation; keep `research` until semantic admission, link this record, name the proposed `C-*` / `M-*` / `HC-*` / `T-*` checkpoint, distinguish Textarea/Code Block/static Diff fallbacks, and trigger re-review on admission outcome, selection position encoding, syntax/diagnostics, multi-document/large-document scope, or non-Web claims.
- `harness.future.editor-engine`: retain `infrastructure-exempt`; settle the exemption for model/content/edit/undo/selection/rendering/tokenization/view-state internals; state that engine selection, persistence/service binding, raw-model leakage, or capability expansion triggers re-review.
- Recompute totals only if a state changes. This recommendation keeps both current state counts unchanged.

#513 should receive the landed record/matrix-carrier link. #514 remains owner of the single matrix. Until that projection lands, #531 is advanced rather than closed.

## Acceptance mapping

- Textarea, Code Block, static Diff, App/backend, editor engine, Proto UI semantic owner, Host Capability/Adapter, and composition responsibilities are distinct.
- Options A-E are compared; C is the smallest proposed editor-specific slice and D/E are explicit deferrals.
- Document/source/engine revisions, transactions, input/shortcuts/IME/Tab, selection, accessibility, permission change, viewport/windowing, lifecycle, and cleanup are bounded.
- No raw editor, model, document/range/selection, host target, worker, stream, language service, or file object enters portable authoring.
- No third-party editor is treated as Proto UI-owned UI; its model/view/a11y implementation remains infrastructure.
- The conclusion is one `next proposal checkpoint`; no materially different viable owner remains unresolved in this packet.
- The exact #513/#514 rows and re-review triggers are identified; their authoritative projection remains the next carrier after PR #563.

## Residual risks and smallest human decision

Residual risks: transaction IDs require a robust App-owned service contract; revision and replacement races can lose or duplicate edits; Unicode position encoding is intentionally deferred; screen-reader editor behavior varies; permission revocation during composition can discard a candidate; view-state/model ownership differs across engines; sensitive document content may be exposed through platform accessibility; selected engines may not support the required separation.

Smallest later human decision: accept or reject admission of the proposed `C-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001` / `M-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001` / `HC-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001` / `T-TEXT-DOCUMENT-SURFACE-0001` graph for option C with the exclusions above. Acceptance authorizes a separate spec proposal, not an engine choice, Prototype, or implementation. Rejection leaves option A plus private editor infrastructure and ordinary Proto UI chrome.
