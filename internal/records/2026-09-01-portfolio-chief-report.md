# Proto UI portfolio pass — chief-facing report (follow-up, 2026-09-01)

## Since last report

Live main advanced `9c8891ca` → `18b9c78f`. Two previously-blocked viewer-authored PRs merged (both after @guangliang2019 non-author approval):

- **#547** — Text Control line-mode (#389 B) → squash `37755def`.
- **#512** — Hover Card demo trigger cursor fix → squash `18b9c78f`.

## This pass posted 4 guidance comments (exact-head, non-duplicative)

- **#571** — CI now red at `6c996be` (Hover Card transition-duration `0s` vs `0.2s`); the timeout-only push did not resolve `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. → #issuecomment-5492337691
- **#551** — deterministic runtime-contract failure at `f9934d5` (`StateValidationFailure` never constructed); Poppy preview failed; Option A/B still undecided. → #issuecomment-5492337668
- **#509** — DCO identity closed (exact-identity remediation); six remaining/current blockers flagged (review-pagination, automation.md drift, non-executable `resolve-fixed-review-thread`, schema-v2 digest contradiction, handoff replay gap, packet-mode digest). → #issuecomment-5492337721
- **#581** (new, Image View Checkpoint C) — required `test` failure is pre-existing on its base, not from its diff; base refresh needed; Codex P1 at `web.ts:94` generation binding + no human approval. → #issuecomment-5492337695

## No-op / already routed (no duplicate comment)

- **#553** — design-vs-Tabs-migration maintainer decision already posed; reviewers pending.
- **#534** — prior Scroll Area / React-race / Copilot blockers cleared at `36999e3f`; only independent approval remains, already requested.

## Standing human gates (unchanged)

#563 COV-001/002/003; #549/#548 semantic decisions; #551/#553 review chains; whitepaper blueprint acceptance (#475/#476/#477/#479); Brutalist admission + co-signoff (#386/#387); #496/#498 substrate rulings; #509 unresolved current-head blockers; DCO/identity follow-through (#504).

No merge, review submission, label, close, assign, or release mutations were performed this pass. Full per-object detail is in `PROGRESS.md`.

## Priority exact-head reviews

- **#583 @ `c2564289`** — prior floating-revision and contradictory remaining-gap blockers are resolved. CHANGES_REQUESTED remains for three new exact-head findings: later recipe centers at Root while Proto centers at Indicator but spec marks mechanism fully adopted; focused test pins only later comparison revision and not historical baseline `f31ed819...`; `rounded-[4px]` rationale cites an anonymous issue ruling. Receipt: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/583#pullrequestreview-5079678403
- **#585 @ `d4d5c7ef`** — placeholder mapping/tokens are narrow, but the coverage gate misses hook-result bindings (`const hook = asHook(); const state = hook.stateHandles`) already present in-tree, so it can remain green while real lowering pairs drift. CHANGES_REQUESTED receipt: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/585#pullrequestreview-5079680889

- `internal/records/2026-09-01-portfolio-chief-report.md`

## Concrete blocker follow-up

- **#581** fixed/pushed `ed041a17`: request-bound decode token replaces mutable generation reads; 23 focused tests + workspace types green after rebase. Receipt: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/581#issuecomment-5499994326
- **#571** fixed/pushed `e6e76a62`: real Hover Card lifecycle endpoint, no Skeleton browser-default overfit, dark motion evidence; full four-runtime file 6/6 + 22 authority tests + workspace types green after rebase. Receipt: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/571#issuecomment-5499994948
- **#551** remains a human semantic gate. Exact Option A/B packet posted; recommendation is Option A (A11y-boundary fail-closed projection, no generic State veto). No semantic implementation selected pending maintainer authorization. Receipt: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/551#issuecomment-5498722020
- **#571 CI follow-up** pushed `fbad7282`: separate Shadcn Textarea React commit-order race fixed by waiting for committed transition tokens; full Shadcn browser file 5/5 + workspace types green; independent review clean. Receipt: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/571#issuecomment-5500560508
- **#571 final CI follow-up** pushed `15700044`: runtime-selector pointer hover is now cleared and `data-hovered` removal awaited before rest shadow sampling; full four-runtime file 6/6 + workspace types green; independent review clean. Receipt: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/571#issuecomment-5501294283

## 2026-09-02 priority results

- **#583 @ `c2564289`**: no new code since the existing exact-head CHANGES_REQUESTED. Old two findings resolved; three later blockers remain (centering owner, historical baseline test binding, anonymous radius ruling). Receipt: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/583#pullrequestreview-5079678403
- **#585 @ `a40e7e30`**: CI/DCO green and previous binding-shape gap improved, but scanner remains fail-open on untraced lowerable leaves and is not lexical-scope-safe. Receipt: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/585#pullrequestreview-5085153882; P2 fixture note: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/585#issuecomment-5505778509
- **#587 / PR #591**: Issue #587 remains OPEN as an investigation; PR #591 (`cd549b4b`) was CLOSED UNMERGED. Real 390×844 component measurement invalidated the synthetic ~204px lag and bounded host deviation during layout movement to at most 1px. Do not restore Floating UI `animationFrame: true` without on-device compositor-scroll evidence. Issue: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/issues/587 · closed PR: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/591

## 2026-09-03 final pass

Main advanced `9c8891ca` → `40ba5fb9`. #583 (6e9562f7) and #597 (e0bffaa6) merged after independent approval — no duplicate actions.

External writes: corrected ledger/report (PR #591 closed-unmerged; #587 open investigation; removed stray `e`) committed `71ad51a0` on `agent/portfolio-chief-ledger-20260901`; posted #539 1/8 tracker checkpoint https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/issues/539#issuecomment-5519619902.

Review/merge mutations blocked this pass: canonical collector in checkout predates merged fork-rollup fix #588 (868bba7d). Re-sync checkout to main>=#588 before any submit.

Still-moving review targets: #585 `183374d8` (scanner/extractor parity), #599 `fbaf80be` (catalog evidence integrity); both CHANGES_REQUESTED with no current-head approval; latest pushes address the immediately prior findings. Independent exact-head approval + canonical submission remain the gate.

Sibling summary: #590 clean review candidate (approval pending); #593 red CI + stale threads; #595 flake fix (approval pending, author self-blocked); #596 7 unresolved threads + security/lifecycle defects; #574 base refresh needed; #586 needs code fixes; #584 research-only; #592/#594/#598 stay open until merged evidence. Full detail in PROGRESS.md.

## 2026-09-04 — #601 -> #609 -> #610 terminal closure

- **#601** merged exact head `49cdd746` as `30ca6ef6`; its independent review exposed residual conditional-container gaps rather than silently broadening the original PR.
- **#609** durably captured R-01/R-02, received a maintainer-confirmed CLI-only boundary, and closed only when the repair merged.
- **#610** merged exact head `b6a6ae44` as `b927d70b` after non-author `cyjin-yl` exact-head approval: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/pull/610#pullrequestreview-5108775771. Zero threads; trusted CI/DCO green; fork Vercel authorization red only. The rebase includes #608.
- Drifted findings were preserved as PR comments (`#issuecomment-5533828110`, `#issuecomment-5534599073`) while formal verdicts remained canonical exact-head only. No Review610 job, unknown mutation, or retry remains.

## 2026-09-04 — next portfolio object

- **PR #595** (`ed147e84`) remains OPEN despite an independent exact-head approval and green trusted CI: its base is 89 commits behind live main and GitHub reports `CONFLICTING` / `DIRTY` / `rebaseable=false`. Fresh `pui-pr` inspection made no write; integration correctly stopped before `pui-integrate`.
- Next gate: author refreshes onto current main, then replacement-head CI and non-author approval. Existing approval will be stale after the push. Issue #594 remains OPEN. No duplicate comment/reviewer request was posted.

## 2026-09-04 — PR #570 terminal

- **PR #570** exact head `c03dc413` had non-author approval, green trusted CI/DCO, all six threads resolved, and an accepted package-local Code Block composition decision boundary. Live reconciliation found it squash-merged as `e814aebc`: https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/commit/e814aebcd4fb020139db358d6ac8b0477d7b77e5
- The per-object worker issued no merge mutation; its command was skipped before execution, then the external/concurrent merge was confirmed and not retried. Issue #517 remains OPEN for the separately governed implementation carrier.

## 2026-09-05 — #517 owner + association audit

- #517: sole owner `codex-517-codeblock` reconciled and reused (no duplicate); implementation complete, validation passing; pre-commit independent review in progress before the linked PR opens. No merge/approval until exact-head gates.
- Association audit across all 12 open PRs: no un-associated PR found; several `Closes` carriers remain open because acceptance/threads/approval are not closure-qualified (#596/#612, #540/#611, #534/#384/#383/#380) or use accurate non-closing `advances`/`refs` (#613/#530, #593/#592, #581/#374, #578/#577, #563/#514, #553/#549, #551/#548, #509/#504).
- No new parallel worker was launched: every residual stage is occupied or gated; only the existing #517 owner proceeds. Full per-object receipts in PROGRESS.md.

## 2026-09-05 — autonomous baseline + PR #619

- Baseline: refreshed live snapshot (21 open PRs, 63 open Issues, main `e814aebc`); `pui-orient` autonomous/schedule and fresh snapshot-bound `pui-assess` derived band **C3** (`autonomousMutationCeiling feature-branch`). Consequence: autonomous `submit-review` and `pui-integrate` (both C4) are blocked this run, so object agents record precise no-op/human gates rather than submit or merge.
- **PR #619** (viewer-authored private Code Block slice for #517): full canonical chain `pui-pr -> pui-trace -> pui-validate -> fresh local pui-review` completed at exact head `b21743f0` (digest `6b893db3`). Trusted CI/DCO green, no spec-entity change, 0 independent approvals, 1 unresolved P2 thread whose cascade claim was contradicted by an exact-head CSS probe (leading-6 wins). Local packet validated (key `13f1769f`), recommendation COMMENT. Evidence-backed no-op: no review/comment/merge mutation. Gates: C3 ceiling, viewer-authored needs independent approval, thread disposition. The `ReviewPR619` subagent produced the pr/trace/validate artifacts but hit a subagent-quota error (credit balance=0) before the packet/ledger; the chief completed those two steps.

## 2026-09-05 — #620–#624 blocked on subagent infrastructure

- Mandated fresh single-object Subagents for PRs #620, #621, #622, #623, #624 could not run: the subagent runtime is out of capacity. `ReviewPR619` consumed its remaining budget mid-run (credit balance=0), and the probe spawn `ReviewPR620` exited in 23.6s with `429 usage_limit_reached` on an independent model route. Two distinct failure modes across two spawns rule out a transient or single-model issue.
- No object work was silently dropped or replaced: each still requires a fresh per-object Subagent under the same cardinality and canonical chain. No GitHub mutation occurred for any of #620–#624. Next step when the subagent runtime capacity returns: run one fresh Subagent per object in ascending order.

## 2026-09-06 — capacity-gated no-op

- One capacity probe returned `CAPACITY_OK`; fresh autonomous/schedule orientation and a snapshot-bound C4 assessment then completed. The first real object worker, `ReviewPR620-2`, failed after 11m43s with quota category `insufficient_user_quota` (HTTP 400, credit balance 0, required 34546; request `20260906014506232841970c955d568UbAZuSVy`).
- Per pass contract: stopped immediately, did not retry, did not dispatch #621–#624, and did not substitute chief-context object work. Zero GitHub mutations; PR #620 has no accepted terminal outcome from this pass.

## 2026-09-07 — resume: #620/#622 merged externally, #621 is an Issue

- Capacity restored (probe `CAPACITY_OK`). Fresh C4 assessment (`e72f10a2`, expires 04:12:42+08:00) bound to snapshot: main `da5934d1`, 21 open PRs, 61 open Issues.
- PR #620 (Base Table spec) and PR #622 (shadcn Base Tooltip) were merged externally during the day by `cyjin-yl` (merge commits `0fa7dda5`, `da5934d1`); both recorded terminal with zero pass mutations. #621 is an open unassigned implementation Issue — no claim scope exists, so it is a proposal-only candidate. #619 received external CHANGES_REQUESTED from `guangliang2019`. Remaining mandated objects: PR #623 and PR #624, each via a fresh single-object worker.

## 2026-09-07 — PR #623 exact-head no-op

- Fresh single-object worker `ReviewPR623Fresh` completed `pui-pr -> pui-trace -> pui-validate -> fresh-context pui-review` at exact head `a225b656` and canonical digest `ba3332d3`. Focused end-follow/module/Web/projection tests and catalog checks passed; trusted exact-head CI/DCO are green; all 15 threads are resolved.
- Review result is `REQUEST_CHANGES` for high-confidence P2 **PR623-MODULE-EPOCH-REPLACEMENT**: a Host Capability replacement reentrant from `applySnapshot()` can let the retired lease's snapshot overwrite the new `unresolved/off/idle` state with stale `system/following/applied` facts. Repair requires invalidating the in-progress snapshot epoch on attach/capability replacement plus a regression fixture.
- Zero GitHub mutations. Canonical review preflight failed closed because viewer `cyjin-yl` is the PR author; the standing schedule scope cannot submit a self-disposition. Integration is blocked by the finding, spec-entity acceptance, missing independent exact-head approval, and `BLOCKED` merge state. Recheck only after remediation and a fresh canonical chain.

## 2026-09-07 — PR #624 remains blocked; route switches to PR #563

- Fresh worker `ReconcilePR624Fresh` bound exact head `6c31db1f` to canonical digest `0cb2fb62`: `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `MERGEABLE` / `BLOCKED`, trusted `CI/test` failed, exact-head F-01/F-02 remain, thread `PRRT_kwDOMhQZjc6fuLJn` is unresolved, and no independent approval exists.
- Zero mutation. The worker stopped at `pui-pr`; no deeper review or integration path was entered. Recheck only after a repaired head, superseded change request, all threads resolved, green trusted CI/DCO, non-author exact-head approval, and `CLEAN` state.
- Current user steering now starts a new `human-assisted/current-user` remediation chain for PR #563. #618/#581/#593 are deferred; their APPROVED+CLEAN summaries remain stale until distinct fresh object workers revalidate them.

## 2026-09-07 — PR #563 remediation stopped on one 429

- A new `human-assisted/current-user` orientation validated and dispatched fresh PR #563-only implementer `ImplementPR563Findings` for the seven named coverage-matrix findings, RED-first fixtures, dedicated worktree, focused/browser evidence, safe PR-branch push, and later independent review.
- The worker failed after 5m05s with HTTP 429 `token plan entitlement exhausted` (`quota_exceeded_error`, `param=8`) before PR-specific collection or work. Per pass contract: no retry and no chief substitution.
- Zero PR/product/GitHub mutations and no exact-head conclusion. All seven findings, validation, push, and independent review remain pending until capacity returns and another newly oriented fresh object worker re-collects live state.
