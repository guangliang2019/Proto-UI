# Phase 0 run-ledger entry template

Use this shape for new entries in `runs.yaml`. Historical entries keep their legacy fields and are read through the compatibility path.

For every schema-v2 run, record stable, non-secret Observer and Verifier `actorId` and `taskId` values. Both identifiers must differ across the two roles and must exactly match any linked schema-v2 finding.

For a completed remediation, use `automatedCompletion.status: complete`, passed validation, the completion date, and the independently reviewed packet. `integration.status: eligible` records a non-baseline descendant commit whose complete changed-path inventory exactly matches `changeInventory.exactPaths` in the independently reviewed packet contained by that commit and whose canonical reviewed-content diff matches the packet's `reviewedContentDigest`. `integrated` additionally requires the live exact-head squash receipt containing `repositoryId`, pull-request number, authorized `authorizationId`, reviewed `headSha`, matching `liveHeadSha`, `mergeCommitSha`, `mergeMethod: squash`, and RFC 3339 `mergedAt`. Never record integration from an unbound write or an unknown outcome.
