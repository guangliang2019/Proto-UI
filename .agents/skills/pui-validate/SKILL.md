name: pui-validate
description: Select, run, and report proportional Proto UI validation for a completed change. Use before review, handoff, commit, or pull request updates, and after resolving validation failures. Cover focused evidence first, then affected graph, types, docs, packaging, consumers, release, or repository checks according to risk.

# Validate a change

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, the actual diff, the `pui-trace` map, and the governed validation boundary.
2. Check worktree and generated-file discipline before running tests.
3. Run focused evidence first. Confirm it exercises the intended failure and owning layer.
4. Expand through affected entity graph, Runtime or Adapter integration, types, public docs, package surfaces, consumer smoke, and release governance as the change requires.
5. Run generators before their corresponding check mode. Never hand-edit generated output.
6. Record command, exit status, relevant output, environment, and skipped checks. Do not claim a check that did not run.
7. Separate machine evidence, observable acceptance evidence, authority resolution, and deployment evidence.
8. Return failures to the owning skill with the smallest useful diagnosis.

Passing checks establish technical evidence, not product correctness, review approval, merge permission, or release authorization.

## Evidence discipline

Apply these principles to every validation round; they are methodology, not a checklist of known bugs:

1. Bind assertions to rendered output. Internal state facts prove wiring, not behavior; an observable claim must resolve against computed geometry, paint, positioning, or screen evidence.
2. Probe transitions, not states. Sample adjacent states pairwise and assert on the deltas between them; most regressions live in the difference between two frames, invisible to isolated snapshots.
3. Re-assert dependents. Observing or changing a surface obligates re-verifying every surface anchored to, composed with, or layered above it.
4. Attribute every expectation. Each expected value names its authority (spec anchor or upstream reference); an observable behavior with no cited authority is itself a finding.
5. Scope expectations per family. Behavioral assumptions never transfer across design languages; each expectation needs a fresh citation inside its own family.
6. Exercise live boundaries. Any path that depends on an external live system must be run against that system, not only against synthetic fixtures.

## Explicit handoff

Do not load or execute another skill. Return exactly one handoff conforming to `internal/agent-operations/schemas/skill-handoff.schema.json`. Carry required prior artifacts by reference, include every artifact this leaf produces according to `skills.yaml`, and set `nextSkillId` to one eligible registered leaf or `null`.

Communicate with the user in the user's current language. Keep commands and paths exact.
