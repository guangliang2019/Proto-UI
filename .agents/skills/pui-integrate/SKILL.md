description: Integrate one already reviewed Proto UI pull request at its exact head when current-user or active standing authorization, live GitHub permission, trusted CI, review state, and repository rules all agree. Use only after pui-review; do not use to manufacture approval or bypass a blocked pull request.

# Integrate a reviewed pull request

Execute a reviewed integration decision without adding another approval prompt.

1. Require the validated `pui-review` handoff, canonical review-input, clean `APPROVE` packet, exact head SHA, and one explicit-current-user or active standing merge authorization.
2. Re-collect the canonical v4 input live. Reject any changed PR author, body, commit message or author/committer identity, review, conversation comment, reply, thread, check provenance, file, base, or head.
3. Require a fresh eligible C2 mutation ceiling in `autonomous` mode. The independent review packet has already applied the content-specific C1-C4 review class. Treat assessment only as advice in `human-assisted` mode. Assessment never grants GitHub permission or approval.
4. Require the target base fixed by the authorization, successful trusted repository CI, the separately configured trusted DCO status, no active `CHANGES_REQUESTED` from any reviewer, every review thread resolved, and at least one exact-head approval from a reviewer distinct from the pull-request author and every commit author/committer platform login. Missing commit contributor identity fails closed, and an approval with unavailable reviewer identity never counts. An old-head change request—including one whose reviewer identity is unavailable—remains active until GitHub reports it dismissed or a known same reviewer supersedes it; updated packet evidence alone never clears platform review state. DCO success does not replace the reviewer's source/license provenance judgment.
5. Require GitHub to report the exact head `MERGEABLE` and `CLEAN`, plus a live credential with write, maintain, or admin permission. Repository rules remain authoritative and cannot be bypassed.
6. Run `pnpm agent:review -- merge-pull-request --packet <packet.json> --input <review-input.json> --handoff <handoff.json> [--assessment <result.json>] [--external-evidence-file <evidence.json>] --authorization <explicit-current-user|proto-ui-scheduled-merge-v1>`.
7. Use only the command's exact-head merge write. It sends `sha` equal to the inspected head and the authorization's fixed merge method. Do not follow preflight with `gh pr merge`, a web click, force, admin bypass, or another unbound write.
8. Treat `allowed: false` as a terminal no-write result for this input. After an unknown write outcome, accept only the command's single live reconciliation; a pull request found merged during that reconciliation remains unattributed and cannot become this invocation's successful receipt. Never retry blindly.
9. Return the mutation receipt. Integration does not authorize publication, release, lifecycle promotion, access, secrets, rulesets, or any later action.

An active standing authorization makes clean exact-head integration the default once platform-contributor-independent approval, trusted CI, trusted DCO status, resolved threads, live permission, and GitHub readiness agree. The independent reviewer may be another authorized Agent, and governed spec changes use this same evidence path. A packet pauses only when it declares unresolved product direction or a privileged or irreversible operation.

## Explicit handoff

Do not load or execute another skill. Return exactly one terminal handoff conforming to `internal/agent-operations/schemas/skill-handoff.schema.json`, carrying the registered `mutation-receipt` and relevant prior artifacts by reference, with `nextSkillId` set to `null`.

Communicate with the user in the user's current language. Keep repository, pull-request, SHA, review, check, and receipt references exact.
