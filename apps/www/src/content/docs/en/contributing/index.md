Contributions are welcome. You do not need to join Discord, but starting with an Issue helps reviewers help you faster.

- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Pick a path: adapters, prototypes, docs, website, or community
- Open an Issue before large changes

If you are new, start with the [Whitepaper Overview](/en/overview/whitepaper/) to understand the project philosophy.
