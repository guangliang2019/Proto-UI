title: 'Why You Usually Do Not Need a New Prototype'
description: 'Distinguish maintenance, composition, design-language projection, and a new Base semantic subject.'
---

Proto UI provides Prototype authoring APIs, but that does not mean contributors should frequently add new protocol identities. A safer starting point is:

> Find the applicable `P-*` and `T-*` entities first, then decide whether the work is maintenance, composition, a design-language projection, or a candidate for a genuinely new Base semantic identity.

This is a boundary guide. Existing governed subjects move directly into maintenance, projection, or implementation. For a genuinely new Base subject, the only unresolved semantic decision is whether Proto UI admits the independent identity. Research, a candidate P/T graph, draft entities, implementation probes, and executable evidence may proceed before that decision and should make it easier. Keep the candidate explicitly draft until admission, then continue through [Implementing a Governed Base Semantic Slice](/en/build/prototypes/implementing-an-approved-base-slice/).

## Identify the kind of work first

### Maintain an existing Prototype

When an applicable `P-*` already exists and behavior, tests, exports, CLI, docs, or demos disagree with it, follow [Maintaining an Existing Prototype](/en/build/prototypes/maintaining-an-existing-prototype/).

### Compose existing capabilities

When the goal is to compose existing components or Prototypes into a higher-level experience, that composition normally belongs to the host, framework, or compiler layer. `K-PROTOTYPE-COMPOSITION-0001` states that the core template language does not provide prototype-to-prototype composition.

Do not create a Base identity merely to obtain a convenient directory name or composition entry point.

### Project a design language

When Base already owns state, events, focus, accessibility, or context semantics, and the change is mainly:

- variants, sizes, or visual anatomy;
- style tokens and rules;
- an upstream design-system compatibility boundary; or
- an explicit visual or API delta;

the subject is more likely a Base projection or styled-only Prototype. See [Projecting Base into a Design Language](/en/build/prototypes/projecting-base-into-a-design-language/) for the complete workflow.

### Propose a new Base semantic subject

A subject merits a proposal only when it owns an independent, testable, cross-host-stable information path:

- input facts and their owner are explicit;
- observable outputs and synchronization rules are explicit;
- existing Base protocols or composition cannot express it without loss;
- visual, business, layout, Form, and announcement responsibilities outside its ownership are explicit negative boundaries; and
- every retained criterion can map to substantive executable evidence.

A familiar component name, a directory in a popular design system, or a styled library's desire for an inheritance point is not Base-admission evidence.

## What `asHook` can solve—and what it cannot prove

An `asHook` is an authoring entry for a particular protocol. It is not a universal requirement to extract a hook whenever reuse seems possible.

`P-BASE-BUTTON` catalogs `base-button` and `asButton` as two authoring entries of the same Button protocol; the [Button source](https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/blob/main/packages/prototypes/base/src/button/button.proto.ts) makes both share `setupButton`. In contrast, `P-SHADCN-BUTTON` explicitly has a direct entry and no additional authored asHook.

Therefore:

- confirm that an existing protocol-specific asHook belongs to the applicable P entity before using it;
- do not use a hook such as `asButton` as generic behavior substrate for another Base protocol;
- do not add an empty asHook merely for file or API symmetry; and
- let the entity boundary and real authoring surface decide whether direct and authored-asHook entries both exist.

## A practical decision line

Before writing code, answer these questions in order:

1. Is there an applicable P/T graph that makes this maintenance?
2. Is this host- or framework-level composition?
3. Is this only a design-language delta over existing Base semantics?
4. If it is a new Base subject, is the admission decision recorded, or is the work clearly marked as a candidate draft?
5. Are lifecycle, criteria, relations, sources, and evidence explicit?

The first three answers route existing governed work immediately. When only Base admission remains unresolved, begin with the candidate graph, draft entity, implementation probe, and evidence rather than presenting the new identity as already governed.

## Lifecycle note

`P-BASE-BUTTON` and `P-SHADCN-BUTTON`, referenced here, are currently `draft`. They describe the current cataloged direction and must not be presented as stable protocol guarantees merely because their packages were published in 0.2.0.
