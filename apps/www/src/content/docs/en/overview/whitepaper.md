## Why Proto UI Exists

New UI frameworks and specifications such as React 16, Vue 3, Flutter, and WebComponent continue to emerge, keeping the UI ecosystem vibrant. However, behind this diversity, developers pay a price: similar components have to be rewritten repeatedly across different environments.

Developers are forced to implement the same Button, Input, and Dialog separately for each environment, and as a result, logic and user experience often fail to remain truly consistent.

**Must we rewrite Button from scratch every time a new framework comes out?**

Therefore, Proto UI is not intended to be a new framework, but rather an **intermediate-layer protocol**.

In simple terms, Proto UI is more like a "component generator": it first abstracts interactive logic into universal prototypes, and then converts them into components compatible with familiar technology stacks (React, Vue, Flutter, etc.) through Adapters or Compilers.

## What Benefits Does It Bring?

**From individuals to teams, and from communities to enterprises, each layer gains unique value.**

- **Developers**
  - Eliminate repetitive work: Write a prototype once and use it across multiple platforms.
  - Familiar experience: You still work in environments like React, Vue, Flutter, and WebComponent—only the components are replaced with versions generated by Proto UI.

- **Design Language & Component Library Authors**
  - For example, **Shadcn Prototypes** paired with corresponding Adapters can bring Shadcn to environments that lack official or community support, such as Flutter, Qt, Vue 2, and WeChat Mini Programs.
  - Existing design languages do not need to be rewritten; you only need to implement an Adapter once to expand to more platforms.

- **Enterprises & Teams**
  - Design teams can maintain a **highly customized prototype library** to unify interaction and visual specifications.
  - Integrate Compilers with CI/CD to automatically generate component libraries for various technology stacks, reducing repetitive development costs.
