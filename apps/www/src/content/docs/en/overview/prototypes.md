## About Prototypes

- A prototype is a model of interactive components that includes both logic and optional styling.
- Prototypes from different design languages have different appearances but share the same interactive logic (e.g., Button).
- All design language-derived prototypes rely on **Proto Design** — a styleless Headless prototype library, which is the official definition of Proto UI.

> Note: The API of prototypes derived from a specific design language will align with the official implementation of that design language, not the API of Proto Design.

## Copyright & Unofficial Statement

Proto UI has **no direct affiliation** with the official teams of any design languages.  
We retain and label original authors and official website links, and all derived prototypes are **unofficial versions**.

Attitude towards copyright and refactoring:

- Proto UI does not claim copyright for these derived prototypes;
- Before the original authors make a statement, the relevant implementations are in a state of **suspension with maintenance**:
  - **Suspension**: No further refactoring or copyright claim will be conducted;
  - **Maintenance**: Ensure usability and compatibility within the community;
- If the official team of the design language:
  - **Wishes to take over or claim ownership**: Proto UI will assist in the handover;
  - **Requires removal**: Proto UI will comply immediately.

## Our Attitude

Proto UI focuses on **protocolization and standardization of interactive logic**, rather than building a competitive UI library.

On this basis, we sincerely look forward to cooperating with the official teams of various design languages:

- Whether it is **taking over, claiming ownership, or giving tacit approval**,
- It is support for the **cause of interactive protocolization**.
