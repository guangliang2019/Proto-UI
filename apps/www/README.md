# Proto UI Website

This app contains the Proto UI documentation site, whitepaper, examples, and live prototype previews.

It is built with Astro and Starlight, but the app is not a generic Starlight starter. Its job is to explain Proto UI as an interaction protocol and show how the current prototype libraries can be rendered through React, Vue, and Web Component adapters.

## Content Notes

- English docs live under `src/content/docs/en/`.

- Prototype demos are registered through `src/components/PrototypePreviewer/`.
- Generated CSS token files in `src/styles/` should be regenerated through package scripts instead of edited by hand.
