# Proto UI

**Proto UI is a framework-independent component interaction protocol and a toolchain for projecting the same prototype into different hosts.**

A Proto UI _prototype_ describes the identity and interaction semantics of a component. Adapters translate that protocol into React, Vue, Web Components, and, over time, other platforms. The goal is to make interaction logic explicit, testable, reusable, and portable across ecosystems.

English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

> **Status:** Proto UI is a v0 project. The exact `0.2.0` ecosystem release is available on npm under the stable `latest` channel. Stable publication on the 0.2 line does not imply a v1 compatibility promise; evaluate the current boundaries before production adoption.

## The core idea

Component implementations change across frameworks, but the interactive subject should remain recognizable. Proto UI separates those layers:

```text
Prototype protocol -> Adapter -> Host component instance
```

The prototype owns portable behavior and semantic identity. The Adapter owns translation into a host. Applications continue to compose and use the resulting components through their native framework.

This is deliberately different from inventing another application framework: Proto UI is intended to work with the stack you already have.

A compiler-based path remains a longer-term direction:

```text
Prototype protocol -> Compiler -> Host component code
```

The current release is Adapter-based. Compiler output and zero-runtime delivery are not current shipped guarantees.

## Start with stable 0.2.0

The public onboarding flow uses npm `latest`. For this release, `@latest` resolves to `0.2.0`, and the CLI installs Adapter and Prototype packages at its own exact version so the ecosystem stays on one release train:

```sh
npx @proto.ui/cli@latest --help
npx @proto.ui/cli@latest init
npx @proto.ui/cli@latest add react shadcn-button
```

Run `init` and `add` from an existing application project. The CLI creates a local `proto-ui/` workspace, installs the matching official packages, writes style presets, and generates host-specific component facades.

Follow the complete [Quick Start](https://proto-ui.com/en/start-here/quick-start/) for generated paths, style imports, typed component usage, multiple hosts, and the current limitations. See the [v0.2.0 release](https://github.com/Proto-UI/Proto-UI/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for release evidence.

## What exists today

- Official Adapters for **React**, **Vue**, and **Web Components**.
- A Base prototype library for reusable interaction protocols.
- A Shadcn-derived prototype library that layers a design-language surface over Base protocols.
- A Lucide-derived icon prototype library with per-icon import paths.
- A CLI for initialization, exact-version package installation, style generation, and host component facades.
- A machine-validated spec catalog connecting knowledge, decisions, contracts, prototypes, modules, host capabilities, conformance cases, and executable test paths.

## Current boundaries

- `0.2.0` is stable on the npm `latest` channel, but v0 APIs, generated structure, and protocol details may continue to evolve in later releases.
- The current CLI installs official Prototype packages and generates local component facades; it does not yet vendor styled prototype source into the application for direct editing.
- Shadcn compatibility is intentional but incomplete. Proto UI deliberately does not expose Radix-style `asChild` in the current model.
- The Adapter architecture carries a runtime. Compiler output and zero-runtime delivery remain future work.
- Documentation, real-project trial evidence, SSR coverage, accessibility validation, and bundle analysis are still being expanded.
- Most catalog entities are still `draft`; catalog presence should not be confused with a stable public guarantee.

Proto UI is currently best suited to experiments, controlled adoption, component-system research, and teams that can evaluate v0 compatibility boundaries.

## Project truth and documentation

Proto UI uses versioned entities under [`spec/**`](spec/) as its machine-governed source of truth. Entity lifecycle matters: `active` records a current stable guarantee, while `draft` records cataloged work in progress.

The older [`internal/contracts/**`](internal/contracts/) documents are being progressively superseded. They remain useful for explanation and for subjects that are not fully cataloged, but they do not override an applicable spec entity. Short-term direction and daily engineering history live under [`internal/records/**`](internal/records/) and are intentionally non-normative.

## Local development

Use Node.js 22, which is the current CI baseline. Use the pnpm version declared in `package.json`; it is aligned with the lockfile and CI.

```sh
corepack pnpm@10.32.1 install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm@10.32.1 docs:dev
```

Common repository checks:

```sh
corepack pnpm@10.32.1 check:types
corepack pnpm@10.32.1 test
```

## Near-term direction

The immediate focus is to exercise stable `0.2.0` in real projects, fix onboarding or semantic blockers, improve documentation from consumer evidence, and prepare later release work without expanding the Prototype surface indiscriminately.

Module, Host Capability, and Adapter catalog work will continue through coherent vertical slices informed by real consumption evidence. Compiler-oriented and editable local styled-prototype workflows remain longer-term directions rather than current release promises.

Roadmap direction is recorded under [`internal/records/**`](internal/records/); release identity and stable semantics remain governed by spec and release evidence.
